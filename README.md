# BrokenAPI

**Author**: Paul Ritzman, Eric Singleton, Judah Hunger, Nate Aurich
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
- BrokenAPI allows you to get some great examples of Errors you'll run into while coding in C#.
- This readme provides an overview of the capabilities our API offers, as well as the endpoints for easy access.

## Getting Started
- Imagine you're a new developer and as you are trying to code something in C# with Visual Studio you come accross an error.
- When you try and search the web for this error you come across lots of Documentation on how to fix the error. This Documentation can be Dry and you really have to dig into the documentation to find the examples if the documentation even has examples.
- Our API is going to fix that issue, it'll give a code example of the error with a breif example and then a link to documentation if you do want to dig deeper into it.
- To help the Developer comunity We also wanted to be able to vote on error examples you come across that helped the developer and the comments if someone left a comment that helped.
- 

## Example
- For examples you can search for top Listed error, all errors, by category, by category with all errors.
